# Javascript
## building the board:
    variable for the score
    variables for the board size
    variable for snake growth
    variable for the snake speed

    run a loop that creates rows, each row with columns based on the variables
    id each div with x,y coordinates 

## draw
     the snake "4 segments" starting the middle of the board

    ## snake movement function:
        - the snake automatically move at speed
        - the user use arrows to change direction the head will move to next
           but only to right and left of the snake. 
           while the snake move vertical right and left arrows change its direction not up/down
           while the snake move horizontal up/down change its direction not left/right
        - snack body follows the head as it moves and does not shift
    
    ## snake eating

        when the head get to a square with food:
          the body grow by growth rate
          the food is eaten
          new food appears
          the score changes
    
    ## snake hitting a wall or eating it self
        if the head of the snake hits a border or body segment the game is over
        a message is displayed that "game over"
        a reset button appears to allow player to restart the game
